 1. Description
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 This program is an exact simulation of the M-209 Cipher Machine,
 used by the US Militairy during the World War 2 and later.
 The M-209 was the American version of the C-38, designed by
 the Swedish cryptographer Boris Hagelin. It had the size of a
 lunchbox and presented a brilliant design of mechanics.


 In the program you can always call the M-209 Help file by Pressing
 F1. This help file contains the manual, how the US military used
 the M209 and the technical details.

 Special thanks to Tom Perera from the www.w1tp.com/enigma Enigma
 Museum and David Hamer http://www.eclipse.net/~dhamer for the
 pictures in the gallery and the advice and help with the translation.
