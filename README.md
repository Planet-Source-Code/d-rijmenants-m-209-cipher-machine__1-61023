### Description

This program is an exact simulation of the M-209 Cipher Machine, used by the US Military during World War 2. This is, after the 'Enigma Real Version', my second hyper realistic simulator submission. The M-209, the American version of the Hagelin C-38, was a portable hand operated cipher machine for tactical messages. It had the size of a lunchbox and presented a brilliant design of mechanics, developed by the Swedish cryptographer Boris Hagelin. This simulator, fully compatible with the original cipher machine, enables a realistic handling with rotating code wheels, setting of wheel pins and drum lugs, combined with authentic graphics. The program comes with a very complete helpfile, containing the manual, the enciphering procedures from the US military and all technical details on the machine. There's also a picture gallery. Complete with formatted clipboard and Autotyping function. With this program you will be able to work with the M-209 and examine how it works and how it was operated. This is a true reference to the M-209, and an educational must! If you like it, just vote! The install file is also available at http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/m209sim.htm

** V2.1: Updated helpfile (explained some procedure issues a bit more) at 6/13 **
